	abstract = {Exploratory bi-factor analysis ({EBFA}) is a very popular approach to estimate models where specific factors are concomitant to a single, general dimension. However, the models typically encountered in fields like personality, intelligence, and psychopathology involve more than one general factor. To address this circumstance, we developed an algorithm ({GSLiD}) based on partially specified targets to perform exploratory bi-factor analysis with multiple general factors ({EBFA}-{MGF}). In {EBFA}-{MGF}, researchers do not need to conduct independent bi-factor analyses anymore because several bi-factor models are estimated simultaneously in an exploratory manner, guarding against biased estimates and model misspecification errors due to unexpected cross-loadings and factor correlations. The results from an exhaustive Monte Carlo simulation manipulating nine variables of interest suggested that {GSLiD} outperforms the Schmid-Leiman approximation and is robust to challenging conditions involving cross-loadings and pure items of the general factors. Thereby, we supply an R package (bifactor) to make {EBFA}-{MGF} readily available for substantive research. Finally, we use {GSLiD} to assess the hierarchical structure of a reduced version of the Personality Inventory for {DSM}-5 Short Form ({PID}-5-{SF}).},

	abstract = {The accuracy of factor retention methods for structures with one or more general factors, like the ones typically encountered in fields like intelligence, personality, and psychopathology, has often been overlooked in dimensionality research. To address this issue, we compared the performance of several factor retention methods in this context, including a network psychometrics approach developed in this study. For estimating the number of group factors, these methods were the Kaiser criterion, empirical Kaiser criterion, parallel analysis with principal components ({PAPCA}) or principal axis, and exploratory graph analysis with Louvain clustering ({EGALV}). We then estimated the number of general factors using the factor scores of the first-order solution suggested by the best two methods, yielding a “second-order” version of {PAPCA} ({PAPCA}-{FS}) and {EGALV} ({EGALV}-{FS}). Additionally, we examined the direct multilevel solution provided by {EGALV}. All the methods were evaluated in an extensive simulation manipulating nine variables of interest, including population error. The results indicated that {EGALV} and {PAPCA} displayed the best overall performance in retrieving the true number of group factors, the former being more sensitive to high cross-loadings, and the latter to weak group factors and small samples. Regarding the estimation of the number of general factors, both {PAPCA}-{FS} and {EGALV}-{FS} showed a close to perfect accuracy across all the conditions, while {EGALV} was inaccurate. The methods based on {EGA} were robust to the conditions most likely to be encountered in practice. Therefore, we highlight the particular usefulness of {EGALV} (group factors) and {EGALV}-{FS} (general factors) for assessing bifactor structures with multiple general factors.

	abstract = {Computational thinking ({CT}) is a multidimensional term that encompasses a wide variety of problem-solving skills related to the field of computer science. Unfortunately, standardized, valid, and reliable methods to assess {CT} skills in preschool children are lacking, compromising the reliability of the results reported in {CT} interventions. To surpass this limitation, we validated in a sample of 700 preschool students (5–6 years old) the Beginners Computational Thinking test Short-Form ({BCTt}-{SF}), an unplugged 12-item instrument that measures three of the most common computational concepts assessed in preschool research: sequences, loops, and conditionals. The theoretical model underpinning the {BCTt}-{SF} was supported by dimensionality assessment, which suggested that preschool students can be distinguished in terms of four specific abilities (i.e., sequences, simple loops, nested loops, and conditionals) and that all of these abilities were related by a general factor. We modeled this hierarchical structure with a bi-factor model that presented excellent psychometric properties, from good statistical fit indices to adequate reliability of the general ability. To take full advantage of this model, we created an online application in the Shiny platform (https://computationalthinkingtests.shinyapps.io/{SF}-{BCTt}/) for the seamless scoring of examinees by any teacher or researcher who uses the {BCTt}-{SF} to assess {CT} skills in preschool children. Finally, we demonstrated how the {BCTt}-{SF} can be used to test the impact of educational interventions for improving {CT} skills in preschoolers.},

The proposal combines orthogonal Procrustes rotations with analytical rotations and consists of a sequence of four steps. The basic input is a semispecified target matrix that can be (a) defined by the user, (b) obtained by using Schmid-Leiman orthogonalization, or (c) automatically built from a conventional unrestricted solution based on a prescribed number of factors. The relevance of the proposal and its advantages over existing procedures is discussed and assessed via simulation. Its feasibility in practice is illustrated with two empirical examples in the personality domain.},

	abstract = {A common difficulty in the factor analysis of items designed to measure psychological constructs is that the factor structures obtained using exploratory factor analysis tend to be rejected if they are tested statistically with a confirmatory factor model. An alternative to confirmatory factor analysis is unrestricted factor analysis based on Procrustes rotation, which minimizes the distance from a target matrix proposed by the researcher. In the present article, we focus on the situation in which researchers propose a partially specified target matrix but are prepared to allow their initial target to be refined. Here we discuss {RETAM} as a new procedure for objectively refining target matrices. To date, it has been recommended that this kind of refinement be guided by human judgment. However, our approach is objective, because the threshold value is computed automatically (not decided on by the researcher) and there is no need to manually compute a number of factor rotations every time. The new procedure was tested in an extensive simulation study, and the results suggest that it may be a useful procedure in factor analysis applications based on incomplete measurement theory. Its feasibility in practice is illustrated with an empirical example from the personality domain. Finally, {RETAM} is implemented in a well-known noncommercial program for performing unrestricted factor analysis.},

However, state-of-the-art methods relying on target rotation require researchers to select an arbitrary cut-off for defining the target matrix. Unfortunately, the consequences of such choice on factor recovery remain uninvestigated under realistic conditions (e.g., factors differing in their average loadings). Built upon the iterative target rotation based on Schmid-Leiman algorithm ({SLi}), a novel method is here introduced ({SLiD}). {SLiD} settles an empirical, factor-specific cut-off based on the first prominent one-lagged difference of sorted squared normalized factor loadings. {SLiD} and {SLi} with arbitrary cut-off (ranging from .05 to .20) performance were evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation manipulating sample size, number of specific factors, number of indicators, and cross-loading magnitude. Results indicate that {SLiD} performed the best for all conditions. For {SLi}, and due to the presence of minor factors, smaller cut-offs (i.e., .05) outperformed higher ones (i.e., .20).
